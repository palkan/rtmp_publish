## Air/Web RTMP publish application

FMLE-like AS3/Flex application.

### Why if we have FMLE?

We need an easy tool to emulate streaming applications behaviour (e.g. when we developing our own RTMP server).
FMLE is not a solution because we need AS3 codecs such as Speex and it's (FMLE's) settings doesn't look like AS3 params.

### Deps

All libs included (LogoPreloader, [tb_utils](https://github.com/palkan/tb_utils)).
